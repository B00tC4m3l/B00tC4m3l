## 🐱 Contact Policy (very serious, not negotiable)

If you want to collaborate, ask questions, or just say hi:

> 🐱 **You must include a cat meme in your message.**  
> No cat meme → no reply. I run on caffeine and cat memes.

Examples:
- ✅ “Love your repo! Here’s a cat in a hoodie. 😼”  
- ✅ “Wanna pair on an API? Cat screaming for attention attached. 😾”  
- ❌ “Hello.” (no cat = denied access)
