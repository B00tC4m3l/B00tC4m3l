# 🐪 hi, i’m the camel

wannabe webdev enthusiast.  
html? kind of. css? sometimes. js? don’t ask.  
i’m here on github because apparently that’s what “devs” do.  

**status:** please leave me the f**k alone.  

---

## what i (begrudgingly) “know”
- `<div>` soup
- `console.log("why are you here")`
- deleting `node_modules/` when life feels wrong
- rage quitting `npm install`

---

## what i do not want
- unsolicited dms  
- “quick questions” (they’re never quick)  
- recruiters asking if i “love fast-paced environments”  
- **any kind of small talk**

---

## contributions
don’t.  

if you insist:  
- open a PR only if it reduces noise or adds silence.  
- include at least 3 cat pictures.  
- don’t expect me to reply.

## grumbles
> “please stop forking me without buying me coffee.”  
> “i only accept PRs that come with snacks.”  
> “leave me the f**k alone.”

### license
MIT, because even bitter camels need legal shields.
